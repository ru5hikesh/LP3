Here's a simple explanation and step-by-step guide to implementing the **Gradient Descent Algorithm (GDA)** to find the local minimum of a given function. Let's use the example function:

\[ y = (x + 3)^2 \]

Weâ€™ll start with the initial value \( x = 2 \) and adjust \( x \) step-by-step to approach the point where \( y \) is minimized (the lowest point of the function).

### What is Gradient Descent?

- **Gradient Descent** is an optimization method for finding the minimum of a function.
- Imagine a curve where the function is high on the left and right but has a dip in the middle. Gradient Descent helps you reach the lowest point by taking small steps down the slope, guided by the function's gradient (or slope) at each point.

### Steps of the Gradient Descent Algorithm

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Start with an initial value for \( x \) (here, \( x = 2 \)).
   - Set a **learning rate** \( \alpha \) to control how large each step is.
   - Decide a **convergence threshold** \( \epsilon \) to stop the process once changes in the function value become very small.

2. **Compute Gradient:**
   - The **gradient** is the derivative of the function with respect to \( x \).
   - For \( y = (x + 3)^2 \), the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is \( 2(x + 3) \).

3. **Update x Using Gradient:**
   - Use the formula: \( x = x - \alpha \times \text{gradient} \).
   - This moves \( x \) in the direction where \( y \) decreases (i.e., down the slope).

4. **Repeat Until Convergence:**
   - Calculate the new value of \( y \).
   - If the change in \( y \) is smaller than \( \epsilon \), stop the process; otherwise, go back to Step 2.

### Example Code in Python

```python
# Parameters
x = 2  # Starting point
learning_rate = 0.1  # Step size
convergence_threshold = 1e-6  # Small value to determine when to stop

# Gradient descent process
def gradient_descent(x, learning_rate, threshold):
    previous_step_size = 1
    iteration = 0
    
    while previous_step_size > threshold:
        prev_x = x
        gradient = 2 * (x + 3)  # Derivative of y = (x + 3)^2
        x = x - learning_rate * gradient  # Update x
        previous_step_size = abs(x - prev_x)  # Calculate the change in x
        iteration += 1
        print(f"Iteration {iteration}: x = {x}, gradient = {gradient}, step size = {previous_step_size}")
    
    print(f"The local minimum occurs at x = {x}")

# Run the gradient descent algorithm
gradient_descent(x, learning_rate, convergence_threshold)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialize** `x`, `learning_rate`, and `convergence_threshold`.
2. **Loop** until `previous_step_size` is smaller than `threshold`.
3. Each **iteration**:
   - Calculate the **gradient**: \( 2(x + 3) \).
   - Update \( x \) by moving in the direction of the negative gradient.
   - Calculate the **step size** to see how much \( x \) has changed.
   - If the step size is small enough, **stop**; otherwise, repeat.
4. **Output** the value of \( x \) at the local minimum.

### Types of Gradient Descent

1. **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses the whole dataset to compute the gradient in each update.
2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Updates parameters using a single data point at each step.
3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Divides the dataset into small batches and updates parameters using each batch.

Each type has its **pros and cons**:
- Batch Gradient Descent is stable but slower.
- Stochastic Gradient Descent is faster but noisier.
- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent balances stability and speed.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can implement Gradient Descent to find the minimum of a function. This method is widely used in machine learning for optimizing models.
