### Assignment Summary: Email Classification using K-NN and SVM for Spam Detection

**Objective**:  
To classify emails as either spam or not spam using binary classification methods, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and analyze their performance on a dataset.

**Dataset Overview**:  
The dataset contains 5172 emails in 3002 columns:
- **Email Name** (first column): Anonymized numbering to protect privacy.
- **Word Count Columns** (3000 columns): Each column represents the frequency of a specific word in each email.
- **Label Column** (last column): Labels, where `1` denotes spam and `0` denotes not spam.

**Prerequisites**:
1. **Basic Python Knowledge**
2. **Understanding of K-NN and SVM Classification Techniques**

### Key Concepts

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Objective**: To clean and prepare raw data for model training by handling missing values, encoding data, splitting the dataset, and scaling features.
   - **Importance**: Enhances model accuracy and efficiency by ensuring the data is clean and formatted.

2. **Binary Classification**:
   - **Definition**: A supervised learning approach where each data point is assigned to one of two classes (spam or not spam in this case).
   - **Application**: Commonly used in tasks like fraud detection, disease diagnosis, and customer purchase predictions.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**:
   - **Function**: Classifies data points based on the majority class of the closest 'k' neighbors.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Lazy learner, storing data points without building an explicit model.
     - **Hyperparameter**: 'k' (number of neighbors) affects model performance.
     - Requires **feature scaling** and works best with smaller datasets due to computational intensity.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - **Function**: Separates classes by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between them.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Effective with both linearly and non-linearly separable data.
     - Utilizes different **kernels** (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to adjust to data patterns.
     - Ideal for balanced and imbalanced datasets, though computationally intensive for large datasets.

5. **Train-Test Split Procedure**:
   - **Objective**: To assess model generalization by splitting data into training and test sets (usually 70-30 or 80-20).
   - **Process**: Train the model on the training set and evaluate on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to estimate performance on unseen data.

### Conclusion:
The assignment demonstrates email spam classification using K-NN and SVM, covering fundamental steps like data preprocessing, train-test split, and performance evaluation.
