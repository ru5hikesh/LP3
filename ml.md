**Title**: Predict the Price of an Uber Ride

**Objective**: To predict Uber ride fares by preprocessing data, identifying outliers, examining correlations, and implementing linear and random forest regression models. Models are evaluated using metrics like R² and RMSE.

**Dataset Description**: Analyzes Uber ride data to accurately estimate future fares, helping Uber make data-driven decisions and improve service.

**Prerequisites**: 
1. Python basics
2. Data preprocessing concepts
3. Familiarity with data science and analytics.

**Tasks**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Import libraries, load data, clean missing values, encode categorical data, split data, and apply feature scaling.
   - Ensures raw data is clean, organized, and model-ready.

2. **Linear Regression**: Predicts fare based on independent variables using a line of best fit.

3. **Random Forest Regression**: Uses multiple decision trees to predict fares, providing high accuracy and preventing overfitting.

4. **Outliers and Boxplots**: 
   - Boxplots identify data distribution across quartiles, detecting potential outliers.
   - Outliers can be global, collective, or contextual, each requiring different treatment.

5. **Distance Calculation**: Uses the Haversine formula to calculate distances based on pickup and drop-off locations.

6. **Visualization**: Matplotlib is used to visualize data distributions and relationships.

7. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Models are evaluated with R² (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
   - Lower RMSE values and higher R² indicate better model performance.

**Conclusion**: This project highlights the correlation between variables and the predictive power of linear and random forest regressions for fare estimation, helping Uber improve pricing strategies.
