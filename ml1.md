**Title**: Predict the Price of an Uber Ride

**Objective**: To predict Uber ride fares by preprocessing data, identifying outliers, examining correlations, and implementing linear and random forest regression models. Models are evaluated using metrics like R² and RMSE.

**Dataset Description**: Analyzes Uber ride data to accurately estimate future fares, helping Uber make data-driven decisions and improve service.

**Prerequisites**: 
1. Python basics
2. Data preprocessing concepts
3. Familiarity with data science and analytics.

**Tasks**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Import libraries, load data, clean missing values, encode categorical data, split data, and apply feature scaling.
   - Ensures raw data is clean, organized, and model-ready.

2. **Linear Regression**: Predicts fare based on independent variables using a line of best fit.

3. **Random Forest Regression**: Uses multiple decision trees to predict fares, providing high accuracy and preventing overfitting.

4. **Outliers and Boxplots**: 
   - Boxplots identify data distribution across quartiles, detecting potential outliers.
   - Outliers can be global, collective, or contextual, each requiring different treatment.

5. **Distance Calculation**: Uses the Haversine formula to calculate distances based on pickup and drop-off locations.

6. **Visualization**: Matplotlib is used to visualize data distributions and relationships.

7. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Models are evaluated with R² (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
   - Lower RMSE values and higher R² indicate better model performance.

**Conclusion**: This project highlights the correlation between variables and the predictive power of linear and random forest regressions for fare estimation, helping Uber improve pricing strategies.

Here's a brief overview of each concept:

1. **What is Data Preprocessing?**
   - Data preprocessing is the process of preparing raw data for analysis by transforming it into a clean and usable format. This step includes handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalizing or scaling features, and removing outliers. Effective preprocessing can improve the performance of machine learning models and ensure reliable results.

2. **Define Outliers**
   - Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the majority of a dataset, often due to variability, measurement errors, or rare events. They can skew results and lead to inaccurate predictions in models, so they are often identified and treated (either removed or adjusted) during preprocessing.

3. **What is Linear Regression?**
   - Linear regression is a basic statistical and machine learning method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It assumes a linear relationship, represented by a straight line, that best fits the data. In a simple linear regression, this line minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values using the least squares method.

4. **What is Random Forest Algorithm?**
   - Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. It works by training several trees on various subsets of the data and then averaging or "voting" on the results for classification or regression. This approach helps reduce overfitting and often improves model robustness.

5. **Explain: pandas, numpy**
   - **pandas** is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which allow for efficient handling, transformation, and analysis of structured data.
   - **NumPy** is a library focused on numerical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to perform operations on these arrays, making it foundational for scientific computing and data analysis tasks.
