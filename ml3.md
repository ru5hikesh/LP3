Here's a simpler overview of the key concepts in this assignment:

### 1. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Basics**
   - **Input Layer**: Takes data (e.g., customer data) and passes it through the network.
   - **Hidden Layer**: The part of the network where calculations are done to identify patterns in the data. Multiple layers of neurons help the model learn complex relationships.
   - **Output Layer**: Produces the final output (prediction), such as whether the customer will leave or stay.

### 2. **Activation Functions**
   - Activation functions decide if a neuron should activate (or "fire"). They add non-linearity, allowing the model to learn complex patterns.
   - Common activation functions include **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit) and **Sigmoid**. For binary classification (like predicting if a customer will leave), **Sigmoid** is often used in the output layer.

### 3. **Keras**
   - **Keras** is a user-friendly, high-level library for building neural networks. It’s widely used because it simplifies complex coding by acting as a wrapper for low-level libraries like **TensorFlow**.
   - **TensorFlow** is a library that performs calculations on CPUs and GPUs, supporting Keras in running deep learning models effectively.

### 4. **Normalization and Standardization**
   - **Normalization**: Scales data between 0 and 1. Useful when features have different ranges (like age and salary) to prevent any single feature from dominating the model.
   - **Standardization**: Centers data around 0 with a standard deviation of 1. Often used if the data follows a normal (bell curve) distribution. 

   - **Which to use?**: Use normalization if you don’t know the distribution; it’s often helpful in neural networks. Use standardization if the data distribution is known and is normal.

### 5. **Confusion Matrix**
   - A **confusion matrix** helps evaluate a classification model's performance by comparing the predicted and actual values.
     - **True Positive (TP)**: Predicted “yes” and actual “yes”.
     - **True Negative (TN)**: Predicted “no” and actual “no”.
     - **False Positive (FP)**: Predicted “yes” but actual “no” (Type I error).
     - **False Negative (FN)**: Predicted “no” but actual “yes” (Type II error).
   - Metrics calculated from the confusion matrix include:
     - **Accuracy**: (TP + TN) / Total predictions.
     - **Error Rate**: The rate of incorrect predictions, calculated as (FP + FN) / Total predictions.

By using Keras and TensorFlow with techniques like normalization, this ANN model can predict customer retention effectively. Metrics from the confusion matrix will allow you to evaluate and improve the model's performance, ensuring it accurately identifies patterns to make reliable predictions.

Here's a simpler breakdown of each part of the assignment:

---

### 1. **Objective of the Assignment:**
   - **Goal**: Create a neural network that predicts if a bank customer will leave within the next 6 months.
   - **Dataset**: From Kaggle, contains 10,000 records with 14 features (like Customer ID, Credit Score, Age, Gender, etc.).

### 2. **Neural Network Overview:**
   - **Input Layer**: The starting point that receives data (like age, balance, etc.).
   - **Hidden Layer**: This layer is in between input and output layers. It detects hidden patterns and relationships in the data through calculations.
   - **Output Layer**: It provides the final prediction (whether the customer will leave or not).

### 3. **Activation Functions:**
   - Used in hidden and output layers to decide which neurons to "activate" (or fire).
   - They help the network learn complex patterns by adjusting how much impact each neuron has on the final output.

### 4. **Keras**:
   - **What**: A Python library for building neural networks.
   - **Features**: Simple and user-friendly, built on top of low-level libraries like TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. Supports different types of networks, including convolutional (for images) and recurrent networks (for sequences).

### 5. **TensorFlow**:
   - **What**: A machine learning platform by Google.
   - **Capabilities**: Can work on various devices, including multiple CPUs, GPUs, and mobile devices. Supports programming in multiple languages.

### 6. **Normalization**:
   - **Purpose**: A technique to scale values in your dataset so they fall within a specific range (often 0-1).
   - **When**: Useful when different features have different ranges, as it brings them to a similar scale.
   - **Formula**: \( X_{normalized} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}} \)
   - **Types**:
     - **Min-Max Scaling**: Rescales data between 0 and 1.
     - **Standardization Scaling (Z-score)**: Centers data around the mean with a standard deviation of 1. It’s used when you know the data follows a normal distribution.

### 7. **Choosing Between Normalization and Standardization**:
   - **Normalization**: Ideal when you don’t know if your data follows a normal (bell-curve) distribution, or for algorithms that need values in a fixed range (like KNN and neural networks).
   - **Standardization**: Ideal if your data is normally distributed (bell curve), or for models like linear/logistic regression.

### 8. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates a classification model by comparing the predicted vs. actual values.
   - **Structure**:
     - **True Positive (TP)**: Model correctly predicts "Yes."
     - **True Negative (TN)**: Model correctly predicts "No."
     - **False Positive (FP)**: Model incorrectly predicts "Yes."
     - **False Negative (FN)**: Model incorrectly predicts "No."
   - **Metrics Calculated from Confusion Matrix**:
     - **Accuracy**: How often the model is correct. \( \frac{TP + TN}{Total Predictions} \)
     - **Error Rate**: How often the model is wrong. \( 1 - \text{Accuracy} \)

--- 

In summary, this assignment involves building a neural network with Keras and TensorFlow to predict customer churn using data normalization techniques and evaluating the model's accuracy using a confusion matrix. Each part (like layers, activation functions, and normalization) plays a specific role in improving the model’s performance.
